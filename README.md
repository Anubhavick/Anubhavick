# Hello there! 👋

- 🤓 I'm a B.Tech Computer Science student passionate about building useful, real-world projects. I enjoy working on web development—especially with JavaScript and the MERN stack—and I'm currently diving deeper into React.

- ⚡️ I’ve also explored Swift recently and am always curious to learn technologies that help bring ideas to life.Right now, I’m focused on improving my full-stack development skills by working on side projects that challenge and teach me something new.

Outside of tech, watching good movies, and picking up new skills just for fun!

If you’re working on something cool or want to collaborate, feel free to reach out.
